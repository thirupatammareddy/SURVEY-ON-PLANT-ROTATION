<P style="color: pink">Fertilizers play a crucial role in ensuring that plants receive the nutrients they require for optimal growth and development. Different types of plant fertilizers are accessible to farmers, but the two most common are organic and inorganic. Nutrients in organic products are gradually released while the substance decomposes over time, while artificially synthesized inorganic products allow for the rapid uptake of nutrients by plants. However, the organic type of fertilizer is better for the soil and the ecosystem in the long run. Precision farming platforms simplify fertilizing at varying rates, maximizing the benefits of each fertilizer type.</P>
<h6 style="color: aliceblue;">Inorganic Type Of Fertilizers</h6>
<P style="color: pink">Inorganic, or synthetic, fertilizers are chemical substances manufactured from natural-origin elements. Their main goal is to fulfill plant macronutrient requirements. Inorganic fertilizer type has the advantages of being economical, simple to use, and readily accessible to plants. Unfortunately, its natural acidity often kills off helpful microorganisms and makes the environment hostile to other forms of life. Moreover, overfertilizing with synthetics contributes to environmental pollution and global warming. Now, let’s delve deeper into different types of synthetic fertilizers.</P>

                   <h6>NITROGEN(N)</h6>
                   <p>For nitrogen-based fertilizers, the largest product group, the process starts by mixing nitrogen from the air with hydrogen from natural gas at high temperature and pressure to create ammonia. Approximately 60% of the natural gas is used as raw material, with the remainder employed to power the synthesis process.

                    PHOSHPORUS (P) Phosphorus-based fertilizers are produced from mined ores. Phosphate rock is primarily treated with sulphuric acid to produce phosphoric acid, which is either concentrated or mixed with ammonia to make a range of phosphate  fertilizers.</p>

                   <p>Potassium-based fertilizer will promote robust root development in your plants. This type of synthetic fertilizer can serve as a buffer for your plants if they are deficient in other nutrients. Fertilizing with potassium-based products also helps plants maintain healthy photosynthesis and limits the spread of diseases. Apply this type of chemical as close to the plant’s roots as you can.

                   <p>Magnesium sulphate is a secondary nutrient and is used to correct magnesium deficiency in the soil. Magnesium sulphate also improves nitrogen and phosphorous uptake by crops. It is best for crops that required magnesium-rich soil for growth, it is also widely used in pot mixes too.

                   <p>Iron (Fe) is essential for crop growth and food production. Plants take up Fe as the ferrous (Fe²⁺) cation.Iron is a component of many enzymes associated with energy transfer, nitrogen reduction and fixation, and lignin formation.Symptoms of deficiency can vary across crop species, but similarities exist for how nutrient insufficiency impacts plant tissue color and appearance. Nutrient deficiencies are commonly associated with the physical location on the plant</p>

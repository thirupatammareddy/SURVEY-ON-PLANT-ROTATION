<h6>The Importance of Soil Analysis in Agriculture</h6>
<P>Successful farm production starts with healthy soil. The soil is one of the most important farm assets. It provides crops with a valuable reservoir of water and nutrients. Each type of soil has its own properties. Soil texture cannot be changed, but farmers can always improve soil quality by managing the nutrient levels and soil pH. One of the most important factors in managing soil quality is regular soil analysis.</P>
<p>Soil is the system which supplies plant with available nutrients through the root. Physical and
    Chemical analysis of the soil are carried out to indicate the efficiency of soil for supplying plants
    with nutrients in available forms as well as identification of the factors affecting this efficiency in
    the soil. Therefore, besides perfect sampling in the field, soil samples must be properly prepared
    and analyzed in order to reach the correct evaluation of the soil nutritional status. </p>

    <P style="color: aliceblue;">Soil Test:
        Soil analysis is a valuable farm practice that determines the exact amount of available crop nutrients in the soil. It also provides a visible snapshot of various chemical, physical, and biological soil properties. Some of the most basic but necessary micronutrient measurements include:
        
    <li>Determining levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and calcium</li>
    <li>Analyzing soil pH</li>
    <li>Determining humus content, available lime, and organic matter</li>
    </P>

    <h6 style="color: aliceblue;" >Is Soil Analysis So Important</h6>
    <p style="color: aliceblue;">Soil analysis gives valuable information, essential for soil quality improvement. By tracking the exact amount of soil nutrients, a farmer can easily adjust fertilization in accordance with soil and crop requirements. Using farm management software, farmers can take advantage of getting fertilizer recommendations based on data that increases plant growth for optimum yield. Additionally, soil analysis facilitates crop nutrient management by revealing the current soil pH level.<br>


        Soil pH is important due to its influence on the uptake of soil nutrients. The main purpose of managing soil pH is to be able to adjust the acidity to the point where there are no toxic metals exposed to the crops, as well as to ensure that nutrient availability is at its maximum.</p>

<h6 style="color: aliceblue;">the Best Time for Soil Analysis:</h6>
        <P style="color: aliceblue;">Other important aspects to consider are the best time of the year to take analysis, as well as the amount of time that should be allocated to do so. For example, soil sampling for annual crops should be taken after the harvest. In doing so, a farmer is left with plenty of time to plan fertilization management. On the other hand, the best time for a soil analysis of perennial crops is during the dormancy stage. In the end, how often will a farmer analyze his soil, will depend entirely on him; whether he is ready to invest in soil quality and a higher yield or not.
<br>
    Quality and balanced soil are crucial factors for achieving higher yields. Therefore, farmers should collect soil samples frequently in order to detect any changes that could affect crop yield. Itâ€™s recommended to perform a soil analysis every 3-4 years. However, it would be ideal to practice soil analysis as often as possible, especially when growing annual crops in a crop rotation in which case, it is recommended to take soil analysis after every third crop in the rotation.
